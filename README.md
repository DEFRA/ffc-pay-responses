## Prerequisites
### Software required
- [Azure Service Bus](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- Either:
  - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/#install-the-plugin-manually)
  - [Docker-Compose (standalone)](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/other/)

Optional:
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/)

### Configuration
#### Azure Service Bus

This service publishes responses as messages to Azure Service Bus topics.

| Name | Description |
| ---| --- |
| `MESSAGE_QUEUE_HOST` | Azure Service Bus hostname, e.g. `myservicebus.servicebus.windows.net` |
| `MESSAGE_QUEUE_USER` | Azure Service Bus SAS policy name, e.g. `RootManageSharedAccessKey` |
| `MESSAGE_QUEUE_PASSWORD` | Azure Service Bus SAS policy key |
| `MESSAGE_QUEUE_SUFFIX` | Developer initials, optional, will be automatically added to topic names, e.g. `-jw` |
| `ACKNOWLEDGEMENT_TOPIC_ADDRESS` | Azure Service Bus topic name for acknowledgement messages, e.g. `ffc-pay-acknowledgement` |
| `RETURN_TOPIC_ADDRESS` | Azure Service Bus topic name for return messages, e.g. `ffc-pay-return` |
| `EVENT_TOPIC_ADDRESS` | Azure Service Bus topic name for event messages, e.g. `ffc-pay-event` |

##### Message schemas

All message schemas are fully documented in an [AsyncAPI specification](docs/asyncapi.yaml).

#### Azure Storage

This repository polls for files from Azure Blob Storage within a `dax` container.

| Name | Description |
| ---| --- |
| `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT` | Azure Storage account name |
| `AZURE_STORAGE_USE_CONNECTION_STRING` | Use Azure Storage connection string |
| `AZURE_STORAGE_CREATE_CONTAINERS` | Create Azure Storage containers if don't already exist |

The following directories are automatically created within the `dax` container:

- `inbound` - polling location
- `archive` - successfully processed files
- `quarantine` - unsuccessfully processed files

## Setup
### Configuration

| Name | Description |
| ---| --- |
| `APPINSIGHTS_CLOUDROLE` | Azure App Insights cloud role |
| `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY` | Azure App Insights instrumentation key |
| `PROCESSING_INTERVAL` | File polling interval in milliseconds, e.g. `5000` |

### Docker

Docker Compose can be used to build the container image.  

```
docker-compose build
```

The service will file watching application and test files so no need to rebuild the container unless a change to an npm package is made.

## Start the service

The service can be run using the [start](./scripts/start) script.

```
./scripts/start
```

This script accepts any Docker Compose [Up](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/compose_up/) argument.

### Debugging

A debugger can be attached to the running application using port `9244`.

## How to get an output

The service will poll for files in the `inbound` directory of the `dax` container.  
The file name must match one of the following patterns:

| File | Pattern |
| ---| --- |
| Acknowledgement | `*Ack.xml` |
| Return | `*Return File*.csv` |

The contents of the file must match the schema for the file type.

### Acknowledgement

The file must be a valid XML file.

Example below for four payment requests with three successful and one failed.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Envelope>
  <Header>
    <FileName>MOCK_0001_AP_20210826105023 (SITI).csv</FileName>
    <Count>4</Count>
    <Succeeded>3</Succeeded>
    <Failed>1</Failed>
    <JournalNum>JN12345678</JournalNum>
    <Posting>N/A</Posting>
    <Validation>PASS</Validation>
  </Header>
  <Lines>
    <Line>
      <SupplierID>1234567890</SupplierID>
      <MessageId>{CF6BCCF9-B7E8-49E2-B78B-5A2D2652BF56}</MessageId>

      <Invoice>S123456789C123456V001</Invoice>
      <Log>Journal JN12345678 has been created

Third-party bank account is invalid!

</Log>
    </Line>
  </Lines>
</Envelope>
```

The output will be a message per acknowledgment sent to Azure Service Bus topic, `ffc-pay-acknowledgements`.

### Return

The file must be a valid CSV file.

| Column | Description |
| ---| --- |
| Source System | System payment originated from |
| Invoice number | Reference for payment request |
| FRN | Firm Reference Number |
| Unknown | Always `legacy` |
| Date posted | Date payment was posted to DAX |
| Unknown | Always `S` |
| Value | Total amount settled against invoice |
| Settlement date | Date payment was settled against invoice |
| Settlement reference | Reference for payment settlement |
| Status | `D` equals successful, `E` equals failed |
| Message | Reason for failure, error |

The output will be a message per settlement sent to Azure Service Bus topic, `ffc-pay-returns`.

## Stop the service

The service can be stopped using the [stop](./scripts/stop) script.

```
./scripts/stop
```

The script accepts any Docker Compose [Down](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/compose_down/) argument.

For example, to stop the service and clear all data volumes.

```
./scripts/stop -v
```

## How to test the service

The service can be tested using the [test](./scripts/test) script.

```
./scripts/test
```

The script accepts the following arguments:

- `--watch/-w` - run tests with file watching to support Test Driven Development scenarios (TDD)
- `--debug/-d` - run tests in debug mode.  Same as watch mode but will wait for a debugger to be attached before running tests.

## CI pipeline

This service uses the [FFC CI pipeline](https://github.com/DEFRA/ffc-jenkins-pipeline-library)
